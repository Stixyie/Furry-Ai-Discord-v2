# 🧠 AI Memory Management Toolkit

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Groq Memory Manager is a cutting-edge AI memory management chatbot system that transforms how artificial intelligence maintains and leverages contextual memory. Developed by [Stixyie](https://github.com/stixyie), this innovative toolkit provides a robust solution for persistent, segmented, and intelligent memory handling.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Intelligent Memory Segmentation**: Dynamically breaks down large memory files into manageable chunks
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves memory files with unique timestamps for each user
- **Contextual AI Interaction**: Seamlessly integrates memory context into Groq API interactions
- **Adaptive Logging**: Comprehensive logging for tracking memory operations
- **Secure Environment Management**: Utilizes environment variables for API key management

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Memory Persistence
```python
# Save a memory snippet
memory_manager.save_memory_file("Detailed conversation context", "user_id")

# Retrieve and transmit memories
response = memory_manager.transmit_memory_to_groq("user_id", "Continue our previous discussion")
```

### Intelligent Segmentation
- Breaks large memory files into 4096-character chunks
- Ensures efficient transmission and processing
- Maintains context across multiple memory segments

## 🌟 Unique Selling Points

1. **Cognitive Continuity**: Maintains a persistent memory context across interactions
2. **Scalable Architecture**: Supports multiple users and extensive memory files
3. **Privacy-Focused**: Local file-based memory storage with secure transmission

## 🔬 Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **AI Integration**: Groq API
- **Key Libraries**: 
  - `groq`: AI interaction
  - `python-dotenv`: Environment management
  - `logging`: Comprehensive operation tracking

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your Groq API key in `.env`:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
